                    <p class="officer-description director-description">Kristine Romine, M.D., has served as a member of our board of directors since January 2018. From April 2017 to February 2018, Dr. Romine served as a member of ALPHAEON’s board of directors. In July 2003, Dr. Romine founded and has since served as the Chief Executive Officer of Camelback Dermatology & Skin Surgery in Phoenix, Arizona. Dr. Romine holds a B.S. degree in Biology from the University of Arizona and a M.D. from the Medical College of Wisconsin. We believe Dr. Romine’s extensive experience in the dermatology industry qualifies her to serve on our board of directors.</p>
